					<h4 class="sub-headertxt font-recoleta text-center">üí° Xaxis Project Proposal</h4>

					<p>To attempt to resolve the business and user problems mentioned,
						Xaxis pitched a project proposal for a digial marketplace
						concept to the parent company, WPP.
					</p>


					<img class="float-start" style="position: relative; height: 50px; top: -5px; padding-right: 5px;"
						src="/images/icon/marketplace_icon.png" alt="Marketplace icon" />

					<p>The marketplace was to enable Xaxis to meet client requests 
						for custom alogrithm campaign solutions
						that they were limited or unable to do 
						within the current web platform, Copilot. 

						The marketplace would include a self-maker tool section for their data scientists
						to have the technology to create custom algorithms more efficiently, replacing the
						burdensome hacks in Copilot that they were dealing with at the time.

					</p>

					<p>Another reason for the marketplace was to launch a digital business networking 
						community between buyers and sellers (the algorithm makers). The marketplace
						proposal concept was thought to provide business exposure for seller algorithm 
						providers while providing the buyers with their custom campaign needs. (Mutually beneficial)
					</p>



					<p>WPP approved the project proposal and gave Xaxis üíµ
						<span style="font-family: 'gorditabold';">$8 million</span>üí∞

					To successfully recruit the right participants and use the correct

				</p>


				At the start of the project, I needed to know ü§î:
				<ul>
					<li>Who are the <span

					<li> What <span

					For <span class="txt-bold">Sellers</span> that will make the algorthm

					I wanted to know whether the Marketplace could resolve any
					existing workflow pain points that were a result of the
					current restrictions and limitations in Copilot because the
					Marketplace was supposed to be the upgraded code work environment.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>The buyer user type in the research revealed that there was <span class="txt-bold">no longer
							any demand</span> for
						custom algorithm solutions from their clients.</p>


					<p><span class="txt-bold">The Marketplace no longer had business value because clients were no

							requesting it.</span> Leadership felt that it wasn't worth the risk of wasting both
						time and money to build a complex E-commerce marketplace.</p>

				<li>
					The Xaxis üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª engineering team began developing üí° <span class="txt-bold">another
						solution</span> in a different project
					that resolved the workflow issues that a data scientist mentioned during research for the

					Leadership felt this confirmed a lack of need and value for the sellers

			<ul>
				<li style="line-height: 1.43em; margin: 10px;">
					It ü§Ø blew my mind and I was surprised that there can be positive results and impact even
					if the project I'm researching for doesn't launch or üõë stops.
					I learned that this project was more about helping the company make informed
					decisions through my research insights. In the end, now Xaxis can use those
					millions to build something their users actually need and want.
				</li>

				<li style="line-height: 1.43em;">
					This project was also a reminder of how powerful asking the right research 
					questions can be to collect the needed insights.
				</li>
			</ul>


			<h4 class="title font-recoleta gray mt-30 mb-20 text-center">What I Would Do Differently</h4>

			<ul>
				<li style="line-height: 1.43em; margin: 10px;">
					If I had more time, I would have aimed for an
				    equal amount of participants for both user types, sellers and buyers for better balance.
				</li>

				<li style="line-height: 1.43em;">
					I would have done more research methods. My research plan had more methods in the other stages,
					but I was cut short for time and only got to do stage 1 with the research methods
					mentioned. </li>
